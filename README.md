# Arduino Agent

**The AI-native Arduino IDE.** Arduino Agent is a full Arduino IDE 2.x with a
Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built into its core — so an AI agent like
Claude can write sketches, compile them, upload to real boards, read the serial
monitor, and manage libraries *alongside you*, editing the same files you see in
the editor in real time.

There's no plugin to install into the AI, no sidecar process, no copy-pasting
code back and forth. **The IDE itself is the agent's workbench.** You launch it,
point your assistant at `http://127.0.0.1:3847`, and the two of you share one
editor, one board, one serial monitor.

## Why it exists

The Arduino IDE is where embedded projects get built. Modern AI agents are great
at embedded code — but they work blind, guessing at your board, your errors, and
your wiring, and handing you snippets to paste. Arduino Agent closes that gap by
making the IDE a first-class participant in the conversation:

- **The agent sees what you see** — the open sketch, the selected board and port,
  connected devices, and real compiler output (not a guess).
- **You see what the agent does** — when it writes a file, the editor opens it,
  reloads it, and shows a *"Created by Claude"* notification. True pair
  programming on hardware.
- **It drives the real toolchain** — the same `arduino-cli`, clang-format, and
  serial monitor the IDE uses. Compile results, memory usage, and upload status
  are the genuine article.

## Download

**Latest release: [v0.5.2](https://github.com/mixelpixx/Arduino-Agent/releases/tag/v0.5.2)** — unsigned development builds:

- [**Windows x64**](https://github.com/mixelpixx/Arduino-Agent/releases/download/v0.5.2/arduino-ide-mcp-windows.zip)
- [**macOS**](https://github.com/mixelpixx/Arduino-Agent/releases/download/v0.5.2/arduino-ide-mcp-macos.zip)

Unzip and run `Arduino IDE` (`Arduino IDE.exe` on Windows). Older builds are on the
[Releases](https://github.com/mixelpixx/Arduino-Agent/releases) page.

> These are unsigned dev builds. On macOS you may need to allow the app under
> **System Settings → Privacy & Security**; on Windows, dismiss SmartScreen with
> **More info → Run anyway**. Prefer to build it yourself? See
> [Building from source](#building-from-source).

## Quick start — connect your agent

1. **Launch the IDE.** The MCP server starts automatically on
   `http://127.0.0.1:3847` and prints a ready-to-paste client configuration —
   including your auth token — to the console.

2. **Add it to your MCP client.** For Claude Code / Claude Desktop, drop this
   into your `.mcp.json` (the token lives in `~/.arduinoIDE/mcp-token`):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "arduino": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3847/mcp",
         "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <your-token>" }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Talk to your board.**
   - *"Create a Blink sketch and open it."*
   - *"What boards are connected?"*
   - *"Compile for the Uno and explain any errors."*
   - *"Upload it, then show me the serial output at 115200."*

## What the agent can do

| Category | Operations |
|----------|------------|
| **Sketches** | Create, open, and edit sketches; read/write code; browse and clone built-in examples |
| **Build** | Compile with live progress; capture real compiler output and structured errors |
| **Upload** | Flash firmware to a connected board (guarded as a destructive action) |
| **Boards** | Detect connected boards; query pin capabilities (PWM/I2C/SPI); install cores |
| **Serial** | Connect, read, and write the serial monitor — shared with the IDE's own monitor |
| **Libraries** | Search the registry; install/remove; browse library examples |
| **Formatting** | Format Arduino/C++ with clang-format |
| **Config** | Sketchbook location, board-manager URLs, IDE settings |

By default the tools are exposed through a **router pattern** — 4 meta-tools
(`list_tool_categories`, `get_category_tools`, `execute_tool`, `search_tools`)
so the agent discovers tools on demand instead of loading every definition into
its context. A **direct mode** exposes all tools individually if you prefer.

## How it works

```
+------------------+     HTTP (Bearer auth)     +---------------------------+
|    AI agent      | <------------------------> |      Arduino Agent        |
|  (MCP client)    |   http://127.0.0.1:3847    |  (Theia/Electron + MCP)    |
+------------------+           /mcp             +------------------------------+
                                                      |
                                             Arduino toolchain
                                        (arduino-cli daemon, clang-format,
                                         pluggable serial monitor)
```

The MCP server is embedded in the IDE's backend and speaks the modern
**Streamable HTTP** transport (plus legacy SSE for older clients), supporting
multiple simultaneous sessions.

**Security is on by default:**
- Binds to `127.0.0.1` only.
- Requires a bearer token (generated on first launch, stored in
  `~/.arduinoIDE/mcp-token`).
- Rejects browser-originated requests and sends no CORS headers, so a web page
  can't reach it.
- Confines file access to your sketchbook and the built-in examples.

The only unauthenticated endpoint is a health check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3847/health
```

## Settings

**File → Preferences → MCP:**

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Enable MCP server | Turn the integration on/off | `true` |
| Start automatically | Launch the server with the IDE | `true` |
| Server port | HTTP port (1024–65535) | `3847` |
| Require auth | Require the bearer token | `true` |
| Log level | none / error / info / debug | `info` |
| Tool mode | Router (4 meta-tools) or Direct (all tools) | `router` |

## Made for learning, too

Arduino Agent ships extras aimed at STEM and classroom use:

- **Example browser** — every built-in Arduino example, with descriptions.
- **Hardware reference** — ask for a board's pin map, PWM/I2C/SPI pins, memory.
- **Beginner-friendly errors** — compiler errors returned with plain-language
  explanations and suggested fixes.

It also carries a modernized UI (refined buttons, dialogs, board selector,
progress bars, and serial monitor) that respects both light and dark themes.

## Building from source

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, Yarn 4 (via Corepack), Python 3.11, Go 1.21, and
a C/C++ toolchain (VS 2022 Build Tools on Windows).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mixelpixx/arduino-mcp.git
cd arduino-mcp

corepack enable
yarn install
yarn prepare:shims      # create the launcher shims Theia's build expects

yarn build:dev          # build all packages, including the MCP extension
cd electron-app && yarn start
```

Windows has a few extra native-module notes (mostly automated now) — see
[**docs/BUILDING-WINDOWS.md**](docs/BUILDING-WINDOWS.md). Full extension
documentation lives in
[**arduino-mcp-extension/README.md**](arduino-mcp-extension/README.md).

## Project status

Actively developed. Verified working end-to-end: the MCP server and auth,
IDE-state sync, sketch create/read/write with live editor reload, compile with
real captured output, and all read-only tools. Upload and live serial are
implemented and need a physical board to fully exercise. The Windows build is
verified from source and installed; the macOS and Linux release builds are newer
and still being hardened.

## Relationship to the Arduino IDE

Arduino Agent is a fork of the open-source
**[Arduino IDE 2.x](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-ide)** (a
[Theia](https://theia-ide.org/)/[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
application that drives the [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli)).
All of the core IDE work is theirs; this project adds the embedded MCP server,
the AI-collaboration features, and the UI refinements on top.
